{"name":"Commons RDF","tagline":"commons-rdf.github.io","body":"# Commons RDF\r\n\r\nThsi is a working repository for experimenting with ideas for providing a common library for [RDF 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the main Java toolkits ([Jena](http://jena.apache.org) and [Sesame](http://openrdf.callimachus.net) 4.0) as well as wrappers for other JVM languages ([Banana RDF](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf) and so on).\r\n\r\nThe main motivation behind this simple library is revise an historical incompatibility issue. This library does not pretend to be a generic api wrapping those libraries, but a set of interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts that can be used to expose common RDF-1.1 concepts using common Java interfaces. In the initial phase commons-rdf is focused on a subset of the core concepts defined by RDF-1.1 (URI/IRI, Blank Node, Literal, Triple, and Graph). In particular, commons RDF aims to provide a type-safe, non-general API that covers RDF 1.1. In a future phase we may define interfaces for Datasets and Quads.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/commons-rdf/commons-rdf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/commons-rdf/commons-rdf)\r\n\r\nThis library is still work in progress. At some point we'll thing about moving to a recognizable organization, Apache or whatever.\r\n\r\nA draft diagram of the interfaces which may be included in Commons RDF are:\r\n\r\n![commons-rdf class diagram](https://github.com/commons-rdf/commons-rdf/raw/master/src/main/resources/commons-rdf-class-diagram.png \"commons-rdf class diagram\")\r\n\r\nFurther details at the [javadocs](javadoc/0.0.2).\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* Sergio Fern√°ndez ([Apache Marmotta](http://marmotta.apache.org))\r\n* Andy Seaborne ([Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org))\r\n* Peter Ansell ([OpenRDF Sesame](http://openrdf.callimachus.net))\r\n* Alexandre Bertails ([W3C](http://www.w3.org))\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
